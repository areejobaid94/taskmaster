# TaskMaster

## This App is to manege tasks => add and show tasks.

### Tuesday at 4:40 finish class 26 with:
1- Homepage:
![](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-java-guide/curriculum/class-26/taskmaster_homepage.png)

The main page should be built out to match the wireframe above. In particular, it should have a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the “my tasks” view, and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.

2- Add a Task:
![](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-java-guide/curriculum/class-26/taskmaster_add_task.png)

On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.

3- All Tasks:

The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.
